# Get2Go Holidays
---
## Introduction

Hi there, 

Get2Go Holidays is a made up travel agent website. It was created for educational purpose as my first milestone project for Code Institute's Web Development course.

---

## UX

The metholody of UXD was used in the planning and development of the project. 
The choosen project is a travel agent's website to advertise and generate leads for bookings as part of a franchise. As code institute's first milestone project, an at least 3 page static website was required.

### Technologies Used

* Languages

    * HTML
    * CSS

* Framework

    * Bootstrap

* Version Control

    * Git
    * Github
    * Gitpod

### Objective

* The main objective of the website is to establish an online presence and create leads that can be converted into sales

### Research

Get2Go holidays was a side hussle of mine, while it eventually failed it is the base of the idea of this project. 

In order to gain a good understanding of the requirements I conducted a research and visited several travel websites to evaluate what is working and what isn't. The results of this research along with requirements of the milestone project form the base of all the features included.

Websites and travel agents visisted for research:

* [CruiseNation](https://www.cruisenation.com/)
* [THG Holidays](https://www.thgholidays.co.uk/)
* [TUI](https://www.tui.co.uk/)
* [Loveholidays](https://www.loveholidays.com/)
* [On the beach holidays](https://www.onthebeach.co.uk/)

### Target Audience

Generally the target audience for an online agency are people with no specific plans/destination in mind yet but looking to explore. It includes individuals as well as groups looking for help to organise the travel plans. 
Get2Go holidays is thought to be an independent agency/agents and based on the research conducted best targetting couples with out of ordinary itineraries such as multi-destnation breaks and bucketlist destinations.

### User Stories

### Structure and Design

* Layout: The general layout of the site created using bootstrap and breaks into 3 section. A header, a footer and a main section on each page. The header and footer is designed to be straight forward with logo and navigation while the footer is to present a number of alternative way to see the agency through social links and include action button and "other" informtion such as terms and conditions. Both header and footer are the same throughout the site to ensure consistency.

* Features:
    * Main Page: index.html -
